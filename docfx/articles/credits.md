# Many Thanks To

* [Tanner Gooding](https://github.com/tannergooding) for proposing a [new API for single-precision math](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1151) for [CoreFX](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), which became the original System.MathF implementation that I used for MathM.

* [Nathan Jones](https://github.com/nathanpjones) for the [DecimalMath](https://github.com/nathanpjones/DecimalMath) implementation that I have blatantly stolen from.

* And last but not least, my wife Christine, who gives me the time to do this kind of stuff on the weekend.
